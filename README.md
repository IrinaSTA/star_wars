Attempted to complete in 90 min for an online coding challenge

Uses ruby's 'net/http' and 'json' modules to access an API of films and characters, to see how many times a particular character appeared in a film

To run, load file in terminal, then type in:

```solution = Solution.new```
```solution.run("Luke Skywalker")```

This will tell you in how many of the seven Star Wars films the character of Luke Skywalker appeared
