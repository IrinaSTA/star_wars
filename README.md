Attempted to complete in 90 min for an online coding challenge

Uses ruby's 'net/http' and 'json' modules to access an API of films and characters, to see how many times a particular character appeared in a film

To run, 

- clone the repo
- change into repo directory
- in the terminal, load 'lib/star_wars2.rb'
- in the terminal, type in:

```solution = SolutionV2.new```

```solution.run("Luke Skywalker")```

This will tell you in how many of the seven Star Wars films the character of Luke Skywalker appeared

One test is included. To run it, in the terminal, type in:

```rspec spec/star_wars2_spec.rb```
